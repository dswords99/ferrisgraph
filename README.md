# FerrisGraph ðŸ¦€  
A fast and flexible graph library written in Rust. Supports various graph algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and cycle detection.

Doesn't use Cloning or Copying for insertion, deletion and lookup.

## Features  
âœ… Add and remove nodes & edges  
âœ… Functions to access information about specific nodes, edges or the graph  
âœ… Breadth-first search (BFS) & Depth-first search (DFS)  
âœ… Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm  
âœ… Cycle detection  
âœ… Strongly connected components (future)  
âœ… More Algorithms (future)

## Installation  
You can add `ferrisgraph` to your Rust project with:  
```sh
cargo add ferrisgraph
```

## Example
```
// Soon
